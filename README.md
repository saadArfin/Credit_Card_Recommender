## üìù Agent Flow & Prompt Design

1. **Session Start**: User opens chat, receives a friendly greeting and first question.
2. **Dynamic Q&A**: Agent asks follow-up questions based on previous answers, storing all responses in session context.
3. **Recommendation Trigger**: When enough info is gathered, agent signals completion and triggers recommendations.
4. **Summary Screen**: Frontend fetches recommendations using the session ID and displays:
   - Card details, images, reasons, reward simulation, and apply links.
5. **Restart/Compare**: User can restart the flow or return to chat for further queries.

**Prompt Design**: The backend agent uses a system prompt to:
- Greet the user and explain the process
- Ask for all required info (income, spending, preferences, etc.)
- Store answers in session
- Only recommend cards when enough info is collected
- Provide clear, friendly, and context-aware responses
